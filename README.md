## Introduction

In this section, you'll find an overview of the Automatidata project and its objectives. The project involves working with the NYC TLC's taxi data to gain insights and develop data-driven solutions.

## Overview

The Automatidata Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative aimed at uncovering valuable insights from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission's (NYC TLC) extensive dataset. Through a series of exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, regression modeling, and machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance the understanding of taxi ridership patterns, fare dynamics, and tipping behavior. Our collaborative efforts with the NYC TLC contribute to the improvement of taxi services and customer experiences.

## Objective

The primary objective of the Automatidata Project is to provide the New York City TLC with data-driven solutions and insights that can optimize taxi services. By analyzing the taxi data, we aim to identify key variables, predict fare amounts, and develop a predictive model for customer tipping behavior. Our overarching goal is to contribute to the enhancement of operational efficiency, passenger satisfaction, and driver earnings within the taxi industry.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the "Exploratory Data Analysis" section, we delve into the initial steps of data exploration and visualization. This phase includes structuring and cleaning the data using Python, generating descriptive statistics, and creating visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to provide a general understanding of taxi ridership patterns.

The code and results of this analysis can be found in the [Exploratory Data Analysis](./exploratory_data_analysis) directory.

## Statistical Analysis

The "Statistical Analysis" section focuses on conducting a more in-depth analysis of specific aspects of the data. It involves analyzing the relationship between fare amount and payment type through an A/B test. The results of this analysis contribute to the understanding of fare-related trends and patterns.

The detailed process and findings of the statistical analysis are documented in the [Statistical Analysis](./statistical_analysis) directory.

## Regression Analysis

In the "Regression Analysis" section, we take the analysis a step further by building a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares. This involves utilizing machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model based on various features from the dataset. The regression model aims to provide accurate fare predictions, which can be useful for both passengers and drivers.

The regression model development, evaluation, and results are documented in the [Regression Analysis](./regression_analysis) directory.

## Machine Learning

The "Machine Learning" section represents the culmination of our analysis efforts. Here, we focus on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave a tip or not. This predictive model can be integrated into an application to alert taxi drivers about potential non-tipping customers, enhancing their experience and earnings.

The machine learning model development, evaluation, and integration details are documented in the [Machine Learning](./machine_learning) directory.

## Key Insights

Throughout our analysis, several key insights have emerged. These insights include patterns of taxi ridership across different time periods, significant relationships between fare amounts and payment types, and predictors of customer tipping behavior. These insights provide valuable information for optimizing taxi operations and service delivery.

## Problem

The NYC TLC faces challenges in optimizing taxi services, understanding fare dynamics, and ensuring fair compensation for drivers. Additionally, identifying customers who are unlikely to tip presents a potential earnings issue for drivers. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive data analysis approach.

## Solution

The Automatidata team's solution involves a multi-phase analysis approach, including exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, regression modeling, and machine learning. By leveraging these techniques, we provide actionable insights for fare optimization, fare prediction, and customer tipping prediction. Our solutions aim to enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and driver earnings.

## Impact

The impact of the Automatidata Project extends to multiple stakeholders. The NYC TLC benefits from data-driven insights that can guide policy decisions and operational improvements. Taxi drivers gain from fare prediction models that offer fair compensation, and the predictive tipping model assists them in maximizing earnings. Passengers experience improved service quality through optimized taxi operations.
